Author: Bethany Freeman

Description: This program has the ability to determine whether a word is within a 2D array,
assuming the 2D array is characters, within the directions of left-to-right, top-to-bottom,
and diagonally. This program is also able to create a 2D array that displays as a WordSearch
given words that need to be within it.
